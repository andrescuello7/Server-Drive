# Server-Drive

My project consists of a connection with a server in our wireless network and being able to send files from any device to the server's receiver, which would be the same computer or device that runs it.

To use Windows you have to install node.js and open apache server
*After that
  + npm i
  + npm run dev

For Linux inside the folder
  + npm i
  + npm run dev
